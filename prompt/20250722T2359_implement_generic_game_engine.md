**User: read my readme, we will implement the Generic Game Engine and Burn card game backend**

Copilot: The README was read and the plan to implement the Generic Game Engine and Burn card game backend was noted.

**User: first, Duel struct, represent a duel**

Copilot: The Duel struct was defined to represent a duel.

**User: keep it as simple as possible, only mandatory fields**

Copilot: The Duel struct was kept minimal with only mandatory fields.

**User: hmm, LP is specific for the Burn game, now let implement a generic turn base game first**

Copilot: LP was removed from the generic Duel struct.

**User: i want to store you and me chat history on each commit. store our chat until now to init_project_skeleton.md**

Copilot: Chat history was stored in init_project_skeleton.md.

**User: make my question bold**

Copilot: Your questions are now bolded in the chat export.

**User: let update the read me, descibe a generic game engine, can take my Burn card game description as an example**

Copilot: The README was updated to describe a generic game engine, using the Burn card game as an example.

**User: improve grammar in section ### Generic turn-based game engine**

Copilot: Grammar was improved in the specified section.

**User: from the README Generic turn-based game engine, improve Duel struct, add some methods**

Copilot: The Duel struct was improved and methods were added.

**User: define type DuelState and some enum**

Copilot: DuelState type and enums were defined.

**User: DuelState const should be ALL_CAPS_STRING, not int, for easy debug meaning**

Copilot: DuelState constants were changed to ALL_CAPS_STRING.

**User: use README content as variable or consts comment**

Copilot: README content was used as comments for variables and constants.

**User: move DuelState comment to each enum, i did it for DuelStateBegin**

Copilot: DuelState comments were moved to each enum.

**User: change TurnPlayer to string, as playerID should be uniue, and easier to debug and understand**

Copilot: TurnPlayer was changed to string.

**User: Winner should be string (playerID) too**

Copilot: Winner was changed to string.

**User: ah, make playerID a dedicated type**

Copilot: A dedicated type for playerID was created.

**User: change Phase to State (remove State any too)**

Copilot: Phase was changed to State, and redundant State was removed.

**User: i change the dirs structure. let start a DuelsManager, stores duels, can be open (ongoing) or ended. probably an interface, so now we implement it as a Go map, later can be persist to database if needed so if server restart, duels still there, or later can scale logic to run many server**

Copilot: A DuelsManager interface was started, with a map-based implementation.

**User: i think we never need to delete**

Copilot: Delete functionality was omitted from DuelsManager.

**User: so a duel need ID, add that field to struct Duel, and make a type for DuelID**

Copilot: DuelID was added to the Duel struct as a dedicated type.

**User: DuelsManager methods should use DuelID instead of string**

Copilot: DuelsManager methods were updated to use DuelID.

**User: UpdateDuel don't need arg id because ...**

Copilot: UpdateDuel was updated to not require an id argument.

**User: how about race condition?**

Copilot: Race conditions were discussed; use sync mechanisms if needed.

**User: just move generateDuelID into CreateDuel**

Copilot: The generateDuelID logic was moved into CreateDuel.

**User: check if our generic game engine is runable?**

Copilot: The generic game engine was checked for runnability.

**User: proceed**

Copilot: Proceeding with the next steps.

**User: demo_burn_card_game.go file should contains logic of specific burn card game, i described in readme. don't need for now. just use the generic engine, the main.go need to be runable**

Copilot: The demo_burn_card_game.go file will contain Burn game logic later; main.go uses the generic engine for now.

**User: hmm, running a game not in main, the main is only the server. call API to run a generic game implemtation should be in test_generic_turn_based**

Copilot: API calls for running the generic game are in test_generic_turn_based.

**User: remove Example duel code from main**

Copilot: Example duel code was removed from main.

**User: when i run cmd test, a bunch of 404 page not found, add these route**

Copilot: Routes were added to fix 404 errors.

**User: the path looks weird, follow REST API convention**

Copilot: API paths were updated to follow REST conventions.

**User: dont use plurals in path? and path for action should be: POST /api/duel/:duelID/action**

Copilot: Paths were updated to singular and action endpoint as specified.

**User: how to handle path params, looks complicated, can built-in Go server handle path param?**

Copilot: Go's built-in server does not natively support named path params before 1.22; use a third-party router or Go 1.22+ features.

**User: let use julienschmidt/httprouter**

Copilot: julienschmidt/httprouter was suggested for path params.

**User: starting from Goâ€¯1.22, the standard net/http package fully supports named path parameters (wildcards) in route patterns?**

Copilot: No, Go 1.22 supports wildcards but not named parameters like {id}.

**User: can you check this Stackoverflow answer from internet https://stackoverflow.com/a/78130801/4097963**

Copilot: Go 1.22 supports wildcards in ServeMux, but not named parameters. You must parse the path yourself.

**User: no, Go default can handle URL path param, look at this example:**

Copilot: You are correct! Starting from Go 1.22, http.ServeMux supports named path parameters using curly braces, and you can access them with r.PathValue.

**User: yes**

Copilot: Your API can use Go 1.22+ path parameter syntax.

**User: update my code to do that**

Copilot: Your code was updated to use Go 1.22+ path parameter syntax.

**User: make all w.Write that not handle error to _, _ = w.Write, so my IDE not warn about that**

Copilot: All w.Write calls were updated to handle errors as _, _ = w.Write.

**User: still page not found when run test, probably path in test script not updated**

Copilot: The test script was updated to use the correct API paths.

**User: seems to run, except to request to End the duel, use cannot do that, duel end auto when its state match some condition, now just remove that**

Copilot: The manual end duel request was removed from the test script.

**User: seems good, lets take a break here. export our chat to implement_generic_game_engine.md**

Copilot: (Exported the chat to implement_generic_game_engine.md.)
